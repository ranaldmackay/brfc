Sometimes cup draws throw up ties that have that extra special sparkle about them. 

Perhaps a chance for a lower league team to play one of the big guns, a chance for players to play, spectators to spectate and treasurers to treasure the promise of a share of a large gate at one of the big venues of Scottish football; perhaps the kind draw which gives you the strong hope of an easy progression into the next round.

**Or perhaps an occasion to renew an old rivalry.**

The draw for the first round of the IRN-BRU Cup took place this morning at Hampden Park. For Brora Rangers and Ross County it has thrown up exactly that. Whilst Cove Rangers and Formartine will entertain the Dundee and Aberdeen youngsters respectively, ourselves and Turriff take to the road to represent the Highland League in the new look competition.

Our success over the past few seasons has seen a resurgance in interest in our Club, not least from a younger fan base for whom Ross County have always been in a different League, quite literally. For those Cattachs who have been supporting Brora before the 1995/96 season though, Ross County mean something quite different. The Staggies were *the* rivals.

In the days before Wick Academy filled the gap left by Ross County and before the Dornoch Bridge filled the gap over the firth, the short trip south over the tortuous Struie had many happy outcomes.

The full draw is:

**North Section**
 
- Cove Rangers v Dundee U20s
- East Stirlingshire v Montrose
- Formartine United v Aberdeen U20s
- Inverness CT U20s v Arbroath
- **Ross County U20s v Brora Rangers**
- Stirling Albion v Heart of Midlothian U20s
- St Johnstone U20s v Turriff United
 
**South Section**
 
- Berwick Rangers v Spartans
- Celtic U20s v Annan Athletic
- Clyde v Partick Thistle U20s
- Cumbernauld Colts v Hamilton Accies U20s
- Motherwell U20s v Edinburgh City
- Queenâ€™s Park v Kilmarnock U20s
- Rangers U20s v University of Stirling

Thanks to the draw this morning we can recommence the rivalry in early August. The match date, venue and kick-off will be confirmed soon ... keep the evenings of the 2nd and 3rd of August free.
