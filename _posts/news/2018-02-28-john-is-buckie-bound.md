description: More changes in the Brora Rangers playing squad for the 2016-17 season

Brora Rangers can confirm that John Macleod has been transferred to Buckie Thistle after both clubs agreed terms for the player.

Speaking on behalf of the Brora Rangers Board, William Powrie thanked John for his service to the club during his short time at Dudgeon Park and wished him every success at his new club.

Despite being an "old fashioned centre forward" John will be fondly remembered by Cattach fans for his goalkeeping heroics at Formartine when as a substitute goalkeeper he saved the penalty that saw Brora progress to the next round and eventually go on and win the Highland League Cup.

The centre forward role is a keenly contested position within the Brora squad and after opening his account with 2 debut goals against his new club, John went on to score a further 14 goals for us in his spell with the Cattachs.

Scott Graham has been placed on the transfer list and Stevie Martin has also left the Club. Lewis Grant will also be unavailable for much of this season as the teenager heads south to commence his University studies in Edinburgh.

Meanwhile, new manager Stuart Golabek continues to cast his eye over potential recruits, and any additions to the squad will appear on here.
