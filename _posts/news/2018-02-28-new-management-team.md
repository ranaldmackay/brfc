Brora Rangers are delighted to announce that Stuart Golabek has been appointed to the position of Team Manager and his assistant will be Grant Munro.

Speaking on behalf of the Board, William Powrie said that the club are delighted to be able to promote Stuart to the Managers position from his current post of Coach. “Stuart has been a great servant to the club in his time at Dudgeon Park, and had been part of the management cohort under previous managers Davie Kirkwood and Richard Brittain. He will bring a vast level of experience and knowledge to the job, and the continuity of appointing from within will allow the team quickly focus on regaining the Highland League title”

Likewise in Grant Munro we have a true leader who commands the utmost respect from the players, and I’m sure will be both a very able and committed deputy

Stuart Golabeck commented, “I’m delighted to have been given the opportunity to step up to the Managers position and build on the excellent work that Richard Brittain started last season. When the position became available it was an opportunity too good to pass over.

I look forward to working closely with the Board and team and I look forward to getting the players together after the summer break.

It’s great Grant Munro will be my deputy and he will add a wealth of experience to our managerial structure, as well as continuing at the heart of our defence. At the stage of his career he is at, this is a natural move for him and I look forward to the two of us working closely together.”
