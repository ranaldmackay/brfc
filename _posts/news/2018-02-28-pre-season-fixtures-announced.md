Whilst the time between the last game of the previous season and the start of new league and cup campaigns can be a welcome break for many, work behind the scenes rarely gets to take a break. 

It has been an especially busy time for us with the news of [Richard standing down](/2016/04/21/brittain-steps-down/), a quick reorganisation to appoint [Stuart as our new manager](/2016/05/02/new-management-team/) and allow our new management team to work out the inevitable comings and goings, and the work the squad need to do to prepare for what is sure to be another competitive season ahead.

It's the same at every football club around the country, and we are all eager to get some game time, just as you are keen to get a preview of what your club has in store, and here's your chance.
