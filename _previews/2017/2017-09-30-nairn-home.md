We've already met Nairn County this season in the North of Scotland Cup, but this weekend sees the first of our League fixtures against the Station Park club.

The Wee County are sitting in 7th place in the League with 6 wins, 1 draw and 4 losses to their credit so far. It is worth pointing out that 2 of these wins were away from home, against Buckie and Turriff Utd.

Nairn's 1-0 win over Whitehill Welfare in the Scottish Cup last weekend will have done nothing to dent their enthusiasm and confidence, so we expect an action packed game.
