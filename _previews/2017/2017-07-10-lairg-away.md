Hot on the heels of our satisifying game against the Aberdeen Development squad, we are off along the A839 to Lairg on Monday evening.

Lairg are members of the highly successful North West Sutherland Amateur Football Association, along with our footballing cousins, Brora Wanderers. Their League involves Clubs from Dornoch to Durness, and Helmsdale to Lochinver.

As we head in to our 4th pre-season match ahead of our 2017-18 campaign, reigning NWSAFA League Champions, Rovers are heading into the 10th week of their League season.

It's the perennial problem that Clubs can face in both International and prestigious Gala Week tournaments - as we work hard on gaining match fitness, Lairg Rovers have already notched up a few good competitve victories.

Fully aware of the dangers that Miller Mackay and his striking partners pose, rumour has it that Tokes may well pull his boots back on for this one, and talks have taken place with Scott Miller and Mike Maclean of The Wandies with regard to potential defensive weaknesses in the Lairg outfit.

 The Lairg Gala started this weekend, and as everyone involved with similar community events around Sutherland knows, it takes a colossal amount of work and commitment from a small army of volunteers to make these events a success.

 We are aware we have a loyal band of supporters from the Lairg area and are delighted to be able to be part of their Gala Week entertainment. It's a great opportunity for the Brora fans to turn up in numbers and support those that support our club.
