It's another away day for Brora Rangers this Saturday as we head east to Pitmedden seeking revenge for a 5-0 thrashing back in October at Dudgeon Park.

Formartine currently sit 4th in the Scottish Highland Football League table, 3 places above us and 5 points ahead of our current tally. Of course, there is also the not insignificant matter of the 4 fixtures they have completed ahead of us to take into account.

Clachnacuddin, Cove and Huntly have all shown that away wins at North Lodge Park are attainable this season, whilst Deveronvale travelled home with a hard won point in an 8 goal thriller back in August.

Meetings between our Clubs have tended to either result in tense high scoring draws, or one of us inflicting a defeat which feels far sorer than the loss of 3 points and a dent to the goal difference.

We can afford neither this weekend.

With the postponement of Wednesday evening's fixture against Strathspey Thistle the lads will have had some extra recovery time after the exertions of our Scottish Cup tie. They will need no reminder of the fact we were 2 goals down within the first 10 minutes of our home fixture against Formartine in October, they will also do well to recall a visit to NLP the previous October when Paul Brindle and Scott Lisle both found the net within the opening 13 minutes.

We are both chasing Cove this season and the 3 points up for grabs this Saturday are vital for us both. The weather over Pitmedden way looks to be improving for the rest of the week and it seems like this would be the perfect game to get our League business underway again.

**See you there**
