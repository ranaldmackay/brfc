It's the North of Scotland Cup Final! This time it's Lossiemouth's turn to try to relieve us of the trophy.

Up until now both Lossiemouth and ourselves have won this competition 5 times. Indeed, Lossiemouth took the Cup back to Grant Park three seasons on the trot from 1994-95 until 1996-97.

It's over a decade since Lossie got their name on the trophy, whereas we've been admiring it in the Trophy Cabinet since May after [beating Fort William at Mackessack Park](/2017/05/20/cup-final-report/).

With the date of this final having moved back to it's more traditional time of year, we think it's only fair to point out that we really aren't ready to let go of it just yet.

Memories of a dark December night last season haven't quite faded away amongst the Cattachs, and we won't be letting respective League positions lull us into any false sense of security.

Then again, memories of two recent NoS Cup finals at Grant Street Park against Nairn County and Elgin City haven't faded yet either.
