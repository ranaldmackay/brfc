It's the last of our Season Ticket Taster pre season matches with our one time Highland League rivals, and now Premership Club, Ross County making the short trip North.

The achievement of Steven Ferguson and Stuart Kettlewell in winning the Development League title last season will certainly have made some in the Central Belt sit up and take note. Rivalries take a long, long time to disappear in football, and bridge different Leagues with no difficulty at all. It's not that long ago since a victory over our Dingwall neighbours was the sweetest of results. But it would take the most curmudgeonly of viewpoints to deny that this is a fantastic achievement for Ross County.

We well understand the constraints that beset anyone running a football club in the North of Scotland, not least of which is geographical ... a smaller population, and distance from the Central Belt brings it problems. A quality Youth Development Programme on our doorstep is a huge benefit to North football. [Ross Munro](/2016/12/31/no-dudgeon-doldrums/) was certainly all the proof you should need of that, given his performances throughout his loan spell last season as he deputised for an injured Joe Malin. We intend to continue to reap the rewards throughout this season with [Kyle](/2017/05/17/kyle-signs-two-year-deal/).

We tustled with the Dingwall U20s in [last season's Irn Bru Cup](/2016/08/02/county-away-report/), running out eventual winners with an extra-time goal from Craig Campbell.

If the weather plays its part as well as it did last Tuesday we expect a bumper crowd for this game, especially as Ross County have announced the chance of free travel on their Facebook Page.
