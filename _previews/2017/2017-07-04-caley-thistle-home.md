It's the first of our Season Ticket Taster matches as we welcome Inverness Caledonian Thistle back to Dudgeon Park.

It is difficult to resist the temptation to draw parallels between our two Clubs as we head into this pre season meeting. Even at this stage, before a ball is kicked in a truly competitive match, this is a meeting of two clubs who are firmly focused on gaining promotion at the conclusion of the season.

Caley Thistle will soon be fighting it out with, amongst others, Dundee Utd, Falkirk and Dunfermline Athletic to regain entry to top flight Scottish football. It is only the second time the Inverness Club has felt the pressures of relegation, and they bounced straight back in the 2009-10 season. We certainly wish them success in carrying out a similar feat over the next 9 months.

The man who took ICT into top flight football for the first time back in 2003 is back at the helm, and we look forward to welcoming John Robertson and his squad to Dudgeon Park.

The first of our pre-season games went very well [over on Lewis](/2017/07/01/lewis-and-harris/) with the majority of the squad getting some valuable match time and getting into the scoring habit. These next few games, however, should help get match fitness levels up to where they need to be before the end of the month.

Weather wise, only Sandy has been happy to see all the rain that the end of June brought as he tends the Dudgeon turf for the long season ahead. For the rest of us the forecast for Tuesday evening is extremely promising.

It's an ideal match to bring a friend along to ... introducing new fans to a local football game when the sun is shining and the pitch is in perfect condition for an entertaining, flowing game of football against higher league opposition could see them returning week after week, to the extent they can stand shoulder to hunched shoulder with us through the rigours of a Highland League winter!

It's not too late to buy our [Season Ticket Taster](/2017/06/05/season-ticket-taster/) and catch all our home Pre-Season matches for a bargain price.
