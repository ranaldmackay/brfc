The rest of October sees Brora Rangers return to League business, and what better way to start than the home fixture against Formartine Utd.

This fixture never fails to provide thrills, spills and talking points that rarely die down before we move on to our next game.

It was back in September 2015 that Formartine last returned victorious from Dudgeon Park, but it was the following March that caused the biggest talking point.

The Highland League Cup Quarter Final at North Lodge Park; goals galore, an injured keeper, a striker in goals, a 5-5 final score and the inevitable penalty shoot out heroes and villains.

Just to remove any doubt, the hero was the aforementioned striker playing very much out of position yet ensuring our progress into the semi-final that season saving Neil Gauld's penalty.

There has been little to separate the Clubs over the past few seasons come May, and the outcome of our meetings plays an important part in our final League positions.

We head into this game on a run of 10 wins, scoring 34 goals and conceding only 5. Formartine Utd have stumbled against Buckie, Clachnacuddin, Wick and Cove in recent weeks. However, the Pitmedden Club now have Paul Napier and Russell Anderson at the helm, so the record book may have to get thrown out the window.

Storm Ophelia left the North relatively unscathed, but the weather doesn't seem to be improving much as we head into the weekend. It looks like it will be an afternoon to take shelter in the Stand or the Red Shed to see what kind of storm the the two squads can cook up for our entertainment.

Saturday 21st October, 3pm, Dudgeon Park.

**See you there!**
