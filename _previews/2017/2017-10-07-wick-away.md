With a place in the 2nd Round of the Scottish Cup secured and our North of Scotland Cup final appearance booked, it's back to League business this weekend.

With Cove Rangers on Irn Bru Cup duty, it's a chance to make a dent on the lead they hold at the top of the Scottish Highland League, and what better way to do that than with a Derby game up at Harmsworth Park.

Wick haven't lost a League game on home turf since the 12th August. We haven't dropped points to our neighbours since April 2016. Neither side is going to be willing to let the other upset the status quo.

The Supporters Club have arranged a bus for this match with an 11 am departure from Jurys Inn in Inverness, and then 12:30 from Brora. At £25 for non members, and £20 for members it's an easy way to enjoy what promises to be a great day out.
