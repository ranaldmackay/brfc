This is it, time to get down to business, and we start with a visit across The Minch to play a Lewis & Harris Select.

While we hope many Cattachs take this opportunity for a cheeky weekend break away to enjoy the company of what we reckon are some of the finest fans in the Highland League, Ross and the lads will have little opportunity to treat this as a simple holiday excursion.

The Lewis & Harris League is contested between [Back](http://www.backfc.com), [Carloway](http://carlowayfc.intheteam.com), [Lochs](https://www.facebook.com/lochsfootballclub/), [Ness](https://www.facebook.com/nessfc/), [Point](https://www.pointfc.co.uk/), [Stornoway Athletic](https://www.facebook.com/StornowayAthleticFc/), [Stornoway Utd](https://www.facebook.com/styutd/) and [West Side](http://www.westsidefootballclub.co.uk/). There is a rich pool of talent within the eight member clubs from which to choose a Select to meet Brora Rangers on the 1st July. And with these guys having the sense to play a Summer League rather than attempt to keep a football within their own postcode during a Hebridean winter, they will be fully warmed up and raring to go by the time the MV Loch Seaforth slips in to Stornoway harbour at around 1pm on Saturday.

The Lewis & Harris Select have a frightening pedigree having collected some fine scalps over the seasons. [This entertaining article](http://www.stornowaygazette.co.uk/sport/lewis-and-harris-select-all-time-greats-1-3254755) from the Stornoway Gazette gives some flavour of what we are heading over to face. We are definitely travelling to meet a squad that is *Amateur* in name only.

On the other hand, as we've said, it's time to get down to business. There is an air of expectation blowing around Dudgeon Park and the village just now.  After some disappointing results around Christmas and the New Year period, the appointment of Tokes and The Doc at the helm has seen a return to the form that put us within a point of eventual League Champions, Buckie Thistle, and brought the North of Scotland Cup back to Brora. Our midfield engine, Gavin, [has made his intentions clear](/2017/04/26/morrison-extends-contract/); the hugely exciting Kyle [knows where his immediate future lies](/2017/05/17/kyle-signs-two-year-deal/); few will doubt that Twiggy [will fail to make an impact](/2017/05/23/mark-nicolson-signs/) and our close season business is not yet quite complete.

We also have a real ace up our sleeve for this fixture, ex Back midfielder and erstwhile Lewis & Harris Player of the Year, Digger can prepare for his trip back home with [this bit of Gazette nostalgia](http://www.stornowaygazette.co.uk/sport/new-goal-in-sight-for-maclean-1-2434683)

For Tokes, the coaching team, and the squad, these pre-season friendlies are hugely important. Four games to ensure the plans made on the training ground can be converted into points right from the get go when we start our League campaign at the end of July. For you, however, we suspect, this trip will be more about the excitement of a promising season getting underway, the camaraderie of a weekend trip with fellow Reds, a chance to renew some old friendships, definitely an opportunity to make some new ones, and, no doubt, some time with the Brora Rangers 2017-18 squad.

Despite a glitch with the [Calmac website](https://www.calmac.co.uk/stornoway-ullapool-lewis-ferry-summer-timetable), the Ferry operator has assured us that there will be no problems travelling from Ullapool as foot passengers for the weekend. Make sure you are ready to board before 10am on the Saturday morning for the 10:30am sailing from Ullapool, taking us into Stornoway for 1:30pm. That leaves plenty of time to wash any lingering salt spray from the crossing from your throat as Goathill Park is a [twenty minute stroll](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Stornoway+Lewis+Ferry+Terminal,+Stornoway/Goathill+Park,+Stornoway/@58.2121703,-6.3882036,15.5z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x488df7d37c0f8b97:0xdb150b1948f2184f!2m2!1d-6.387208!2d58.206131!1m5!1m1!1s0x4892082795cb7b1b:0x13dcdcbd365ad0d0!2m2!1d-6.3737983!2d58.2140934!3e2) away.

If we are met with the type of hospitality we experienced on our last visit to Back FC in July 2013, you can expect to still be talking about this trip for a very long time.
