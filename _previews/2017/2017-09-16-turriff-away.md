Saturday sees Brora Rangers in their 11th League game of the 2017-18 season, and it is usually a tightly contested affair.

Turriff Utd kept us on our toes last season with narrow victories for The Cattachs both home and away. Strange to think that this fixture last season saw the appearance of a young trialist at centre-back for us ... [hasn't he done well](/2016/08/27/turriff-away-report/)!

Turriff have already recorded home wins against Lossiemouth and Rothes, both by a single goal. Formartine and Nairn have returned from The Haughs with 3 points firmly in their pockets, and Buckie shared the points at the start of August.

They've all been tight games ... but Wednesday night's trip to Harlaw Park to play Cove Rangers was anything but tight. We've been there ourselves, and there are only 2 reactions to a result like a 5-1 defeat. You either let the heads go down, or come out fighting and take it out on the next poor souls who come to vist.

We'll be hoping for the former.

Brora are on run of 4 consecutive wins going into this game, a run we need to keep going in our quest to regain the League. A dominant performance over Buckie last weekend shows we can display the form required to win the top spot. Our tenacity to dig in and battle to the bitter end in matches, such as our mid week victory over Clachnacuddin, demonstrates we can take the 3 points even when things aren't running so smoothly.

Again, we'll be hoping Saturday is a case of the former. But experience tells us the latter will do, just as long as the 3 points come home with us on the bus.

The supporters bus is already filling up for this game - don't be too late in booking your seat for what is always a great trip.
