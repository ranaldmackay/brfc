We are not entirely oblivious to the fact that some of our pre season meetings are bound to cause a degree of split loyalty amongst our support - and we expect this to be a tough test for a fair few of you.

2016-17 was quite a season for The Dons. An absolutely dominant Celtic were the only team Aberdeen failed to record a victory against for the whole of their League campaign; a League Cup Final appearance, again foiled by the Parkhead club, and finished the season with a Scottish Cup Final ... against Celtic ... again.

It's the second of our [Season Ticket Taster](/2017/06/05/season-ticket-taster/) matches, and we are billing this one as **The Battle of the Reds**.

Paul Sheerin takes his U20s to Dudgeon Park this Saturday, and they promise to provide some stiff competition for the Cattachs. They've already chalked up a 3-3 draw with Turriff Utd and a 1-3 victory over Clachnacuddin on their way North.

As Paul himself said after the game at The Haughs,

**"The biggest goal at this time of year is to get the players fit and get as many minutes into them as you can."**

The home support can expect to see a similar strategy from Ross and The Doc, and it's another chance to see new boys Craig Gunn and Mark Nicolson as everyone fights to earn their slot in the starting 11 at the opening match of our 2017-18 Highland League campaign in Lossiemouth.

Our own Youth Development department will be busy on the day too, as they host our inaugural Primary School Championship.

The competition kicks off at 10.45am on Saturday morning with Brora, Helmsdale and Golspie Primary all taking part. It is the first year of the competition which we see as being an annual event and growing every year. The schools will compete at age P4-P7 in this tournament.


We are expecting another dry, sunny and warm day in Brora, so why not make a day of it? Cheer on the aspiring stars of the future in the morning followed by an afternoon of cheering on The Reds ... whichever Reds it is that you've come to cheer.

**See you on Saturday ... "Come On You Reds"**
