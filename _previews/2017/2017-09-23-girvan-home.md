It's that time of year again ... The William Hill Scottish Cup. Brora Rangers welcome Girvan FC to Dudgeon Park for the 1st Round.

Girvan head north thanks to an 8 goal thriller against South of Scotland League side St Cuthberts Wanderers. Despite the Kirkcudbright side opening the scoring, Girvan appeared to be in control of this match and should arrive in Brora with a fair bit of confidence.

Then again, they probably had a fair bit of confidence when Huntly headed to Hamilton Park in Girvan pretty much a year to the day from this fixture. Huntly won that game.

It's the Scottish Cup though. One game, one chance. As William Hill say in their ever catchy slogan every year - 'Original Moments, Unforgettable Memories'

As has become our custom, we'll have some background to the build up of this fixture in our news feed, at the minute, all you need to keep in mind is the 3pm kick-off on the 23rd September at Dudgeon Park, and our fantastic 'Bring a Friend' Hospitality offer
