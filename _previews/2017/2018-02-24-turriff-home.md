Season 2017-18 has been a happy time for Brora in Cup competitions. The North of Scotland Cup is already in the cabinet. We reached the 5th Round of the Scottish Cup for the first time in our history.

This Saturday we hope to keep that particular ball rolling.

A 4-1 victory over Inverurie Locos in the Preliminary Round earned us this 1st Round draw against Turriff Utd. With Turra sitting 17 points behind us in the League, it would suggest a 2nd Round tie against Keith is on the cards ... but things have changed at The Haughs. Kris Hunter is back in charge.

After 2 disappointing League results through the week, this is the chance to roll up our sleeves and get back into winning ways again. Cove would appear to be showing everyone a clean pair of heels in the League, but that is no reason for us not to aim to take this trophy back off them again.

**Saturday 24th February, Dudgeon Park, 3pm**

**See you there**
