A 5-0 win over Girvan for ourselves, and a 2-1 victory over Strathspey Thistle for the Strollers saw us enter the draw for this tie back on the 23rd September.

The Edinburgh outfit are currently sitting in 9th place in the Lowland League, with 4 wins so far from 12 games. As is often the case, that simple statement doesn't tell the full story.

The Strollers had an impressive debut campaign in the Lowland League last season and they are in the midst of a tough run of fixtures against the League's top clubs.

They head into our Scottish Cup tie with an impressive 4-2 victory over league leaders BSC Glasgow at their back.
