After the excitement of our Scottish Cup win, it's back to League business and a trip to Seafield Park this Saturday.

Strathspey Thistle have yet to record a home win this season and we'll have no intention of letting that statistic change come full time as we finish our final game of November.

With Cove Rangers heading to Fort William (weather permitting) and Fraserburgh hosting 15th placed Keith we aren't expecting any upsets for our fellow League challengers.
