It's Wednesday evening football at Kynoch Park this week as we play our League away fixture against Keith FC. If history teaches us anything, it hopefully teaches us that the fixture list is unkind to Keith.

Last season Keith were the next team to face us after a 5-0 defeat away to eventual League Champions, Buckie Thistle. Now they get to face us again after our recent demolition by Formartine Utd.

[We ran out 6-0 winners in that game](/2016/10/08/keith-home-report/), the perfect reaction to a sore defeat.

Despite our slip down the League table, Keith lie a distant 10 places below us with a solitary victory against Fort William and a draw against Lossie to their credit so far this season.

Their win against Gala Fairydean in the opening round of the Scottish Cup handed them a tough tie against Clyde last weekend ... a tie which proved a test too far for them.

A Wednesday evening 5 hour round trip to the far side of Moray is unlikely to be the ideal midweek football fix for the travelling support, but given your attendance at away games so far this season, we know we can still say with confidence ...

Wednesday 25th October, Kynoch Park, 8pm.

It looks like it's going to be a fine evening.

**See you there**
