After a few weeks of being focused on Cups, it's back to Highland League business for Brora Rangers. Snow and frost prevented this game going ahead last November.

Given the current forecast for the Grantown area, snow and frost just might force another postponement and another headache for Rod Houston.

Seafield Park has been a happy hunting ground for us, but let's not forget that they did record a 2-0 victory over us back in February 2012. In fact, last season they gave us a bit of a scare as [our match report](/2016/11/26/strathspey-home-report/) recalls.

It has been a fantastic few weeks for Ross, his management team and the lads, culminating in the well deserved match at Rugby Park on Saturday. But games like that can take it out of players both mentally and physically. The squad know they now have to shift their focus back to League business and a few weeks of Saturday - Wednesday - Saturday games whilst we play catch up due to the postponements brought about by both weather and Cup success.

Meanwhile Strathspey come into this game on the back of an 1-2 away victory over Turriff Utd. Points are hard fought for at Grantown this season, but we know they are up for that fight.

A Wednesday night trip into the Cairngorm National Park is probaby too big an ask for our Mini Kickers that made the trip to Kilmarnock this weekend ... so just the 3 buses expected for this match.
