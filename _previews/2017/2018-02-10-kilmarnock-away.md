This is it. The 5th Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup, and we're off to Kilmarnock.

It hasn't been the easiest of journeys. Our first round tie against Girvan FC meant squaring up to an unknown quantity who had knocked out St Cuthbert Wanderers and were performing well in the West Region Super Premier Division.

A 5-0 victory at Dudgeon Park was to signal the start of our travels in this season's competition as we headed to the Capital to take on Civil Service Strollers. Brora were the ones to stroll into the next round with another emphatic 5 goal victory, and another clean sheet.

Fingers were crossed for a favourable home tie. Ahhh, the power of positive thought ... [Queens Park at home](/2017/10/17/if-6-was-9/). Or, Stranraer away as it turned out. It was chosen as the Match of the Round, and so began not only a fantastic trip into the later rounds of 'The Cup', but a terrific period of media attention for both the Club and our village.

Stephen Mackay's [93rd minute winning goal](/2017/11/18/stranraer-away-report/) earned us yet more media attention and an historic victory against SPFL League 1 opposition.

Our Round 4 opponents were to be East Fife, a Club neck and neck with Stranraer in the League 1 battle, giving us hope that if we could win at Stair Park, there was no reason why we couldn't do the same after the relatively short trip to Bayview Stadium. [And so it proved to be](/2018/01/20/east-fife-away-report/).

Despite a lack of competitive game time due to weather enforced postponements in the lead up to the tie, the team put in a shift which put the Fifers on the back foot for the whole of the first half and followed it up with a backs to the wall performance which saw the 1938 winners crash out of the Scottish Cup.

That second half do or die performance was driven in part, according to Captain Jamie Duff, by the noise and passion exhibited by our fantastic 250 strong travelling support. Yet again, the 12th man earned their reward for the fantastic backing they have given the lads throughout this Cup campaign.

If Jamie felt that possibly Stranraer and East Fife had underestimated Highland League opposition, it is already apparent that Kilmarnock FC are not about to do the same. Assistant Manager, Alex Dyer, left us in no doubt about that in [an interview on the Killie website](http://www.kilmarnockfc.co.uk/Article?id=6739&ShowCat=) after the draw.

Indeed, the Ayrshire club seem to be as excited about this tie as we are. There is a feeling of the red carpet treatment being offered to us ahead of the match, with an especially warm welcome for the travelling supporters.

Ticket prices are £20 with those over 65, under 21 and students enjoying a £15 concession, with cash turnstiles on the day. Of real note is the great sounding [Hospitality offer](http://www.kilmarnockfc.co.uk/Article?id=6772&ShowCat=) providing a tour of Rugby Park, some traditional Scottish fare (including, obviously, Killie pies), executive seating, access to the bar and the post match presentations all for £30.

And that neatly brings us up to date ... 4 rounds safely negotiated, 12 goals scored, no goals conceded. This is it. The 5th Round of the William Hill Scottish Cup, and we're off to Kilmarnock.

All the signs are that we are going to take a massive support to this game ...

**Last one to leave the village, switch the lights off.**
