This weekend sees a couple of kent faces return to Dudgeon Park as Rothes travel west to Dudgeon Park. It promises to be a cracker!

The Scottish Highland Football League finds itself in a healthy place this season. The last time a Club utterly dominated the League was the fantastic run Huntly achieved from 1993-94 to 1997-98.

We had pre-Pyramid hopes of bettering this.

Recently Cove Rangers and Buckie Thistle, along with the restructuring of the promotion/demotion system within Scottish football, have foiled these plans.

Back in 2013-14 we topped the table by a clear 20 points, and 83 points ahead of Rothes. Have a look at the scorelines in our previous meetings, smile, reminisce, and then take a look at The Speysiders' current record ...

A draw away from doubling their 2013-14 points total before October is finished, Rothes are flying.

Clachnacuddin, Deveronvale, Inverurie Locos, Lossiemouth, Strathspey Thistle, Fort William and Keith have all felt the real resurgance of Rothes. Granted that is only 2 wins away from home - against Fort William and Keith - but there was also the recent narrow 3-4 defeat to Formartine and 1-0 defeat against Turriff Utd to think about.

All that aside, it is Wednesday evening's 1-1 result against Cove Rangers that really shows the intent and ability of the Rothes squad.

Such is football, though. After our initial League success it is more than apparent that teams lift their game when they visit Dudgeopn Park. This weekend it would appear we need to lift our game to get the better of Rothes.

The weatherman promises a fine afternoon, recent results suggest an exciting afternoon, your attendance and backing could make it an extremely happy afternoon.

Saturday 28th October, 3pm, Dudgeon Park.

**See you there**
